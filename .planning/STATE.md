- Existing CRDs: `Site` (types_site.go) and `Server` (types_server.go) — both to be deleted
- Connection pool: `pkg/util/connman/connman.go` — `ConnectionManager` is already in place
- Virtual workspace builders: 3 currently active — `edge-proxy`, `agent-proxy`, `cluster-proxy`
- Agent modes today: `AgentModeSite` / `AgentModeServer` in `pkg/agent/agent.go`
