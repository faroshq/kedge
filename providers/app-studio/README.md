App Studio is a kedge provider that gives each tenant a **persistent AI project
workspace**: named Projects with durable "memory" (goals / requirements /
constraints) and a chat surface backed by the tenant's own LLM credentials,
with optional MCP tool use against their workspace. Projects are stored as
`projects.ai.kedge.faros.sh` resources in the tenant's own kcp workspace; chat
transcripts persist in the provider's message store (Postgres in production and
local dev, with explicit in-memory mode available only for throwaway UI work).

The provider acts **as the calling user**: the hub's backend proxy forwards
`/services/providers/app-studio/*` with the verified `X-Kedge-Tenant` /
`X-Kedge-User` headers and the caller's bearer token, and the provider builds a
per-request, token-scoped client (see `tenant/`). There is no provider
service-account escalation.

## What's here

| Surface | Where |
|---|---|
| Provider binary | `main.go` — loads the provider kubeconfig, opens the message store, mounts `/api` + the embedded portal, heartbeats the hub |
| REST / LLM / message API | `api/` — Project CRUD, memory, LLM settings, streaming chat (`/api/projects/*`) |
| API type | `apis/ai/v1alpha1/` — the `Project` CRD type (deepcopy generated) |
| Typed client | `client/` — trimmed dynamic client for the Project resource |
| Tenant client | `tenant/` — token-forwarding `ClientFactory` (host+TLS from the provider kubeconfig, caller token per request) |
| Message store | `store/` — Postgres + in-memory + envelope-encryption implementations |
| Sandbox runtime | `runner/` + `api/development_*` — project-scoped sync, restart, logs, status, and signed preview proxy for infrastructure-backed `SandboxRunner` workloads |
| Portal | `portal/` — the Vue micro-frontend (`<kedge-provider-app-studio>`), embedded via `assets.go` |
| Registration | `manifest.yaml` — CatalogEntry + APIExport (`ai.kedge.faros.sh`) + Code and Infrastructure provider dependencies + the Project APIResourceSchema + `secrets` claim |
| Deploy | `deploy/chart/` — Helm chart (Deployment, Service, CatalogEntry) |
| CI (mirror) | `.github/workflows/{image,chart}.yaml` — publish the image + chart to GHCR (run only in the mirror) |

## Configuration

Environment variables consumed by the binary:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Listen port (default `8081`) |
| `KEDGE_HUB_URL` | Hub base URL (heartbeat + MCP endpoint resolution) |
| `KEDGE_HUB_TOKEN` | Bearer token for the heartbeat |
| `KEDGE_PROVIDER_NAME` | CatalogEntry name (default `app-studio`) |
| `KEDGE_PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG` | Provider kubeconfig (kcp front-proxy host + TLS only) |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BASE_DOMAIN` | Optional DNS zone for companion Sandbox preview routing. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_HTTPROUTE_PARENT_GATEWAY_NAME` | Gateway resource name to attach each preview `HTTPRoute` to. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_HTTPROUTE_PARENT_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` | Namespace of the parent Gateway (defaults to `kedge-preview`). |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_HTTPROUTE_PARENT_GATEWAY_SECTION_NAME` | Listener section name on the parent Gateway (defaults to `https`). |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BACKEND_NAMESPACE` | Namespace for the shared preview gateway Service backend. The Helm chart sets this to the release namespace unless `previewGateway.backend.namespace` is configured. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME` | Shared preview gateway Service name. Defaults to the chart-created `preview-gateway` Service when unset. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT` | Shared preview gateway Service port (defaults to `8080`). |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_TOKEN_SECRET` | Optional shared signing secret for preview URLs; configure for multi-replica deployments |
| `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` | Postgres DSN for the message store |
| `APP_STUDIO_IN_MEMORY_MESSAGE_STORE` | `true` → non-durable in-memory store (dev) |
| `APP_STUDIO_MESSAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` | Comma-separated `key-id:base64-aes-key` entries |
| `APP_STUDIO_MESSAGE_RETENTION` | Retention window (`time.ParseDuration`, e.g. `720h`) |
| `APP_STUDIO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Filesystem root for App Studio project workspaces and local file tools |
| `APP_STUDIO_MCP_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` | `true` → skip TLS verify on MCP calls (dev) |

## Local message history

`make run-provider-app-studio` starts/reuses a local Postgres container by
default and passes `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` to the provider:

```sh
make app-studio-db-up
make run-provider-app-studio
```

The database container is named `kedge-app-studio-postgres`, listens on
`127.0.0.1:55432`, and stores data under `.kcp/app-studio-postgres/`. Both
Tiltfiles expose it as the `app-studio-db` resource, so hard-refreshing the UI
or rebuilding the provider no longer drops prior conversation history.

To use your own database, set `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` in the environment or in
`providers/app-studio/.env` (copy from `.env.example`). To intentionally use the
old throwaway behavior, set `APP_STUDIO_IN_MEMORY_MESSAGE_STORE=true`.

## Local project files

App Studio keeps project files in its own workspace root so the assistant can
list, read, search, and safely mutate text files before asking provider-code to
commit selected changed files to git. Set `APP_STUDIO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to choose
the directory; the binary defaults to a temp directory, while the Helm chart
mounts a persistent volume at `/var/lib/kedge-app-studio/workspaces`.

The assistant-facing workspace tools are App Studio local tools. Provider-code
remains the git-source boundary: `commit_project_files` reads selected workspace
files and delegates the actual commit to the Code provider's `code__commit_files`
tool.

## Development runtime

App Studio owns the project-facing development runtime API. It creates and
deletes infrastructure-backed `SandboxRunner` resources in the caller's tenant
workspace, syncs App Studio workspace files to the runner, and serves project
preview URLs by minting signed, host-based URLs from the companion
`SandboxPreviewHTTPRoute` status.

Infrastructure owns the resource composition: the `sandbox-runner` Template uses
KRO to create the runtime namespace, PVC, Deployment, Service, control Secret,
and network policy. App Studio holds **no** kubeconfig to the runtime cluster:
the live data plane (logs, file sync, restart, preview readiness) is served by
the infrastructure provider as subresources on the `SandboxRunner` instance,
which App Studio calls through the hub as the requesting user. See
[`docs/app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md`](../../docs/app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md).

When `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BASE_DOMAIN` is set, App Studio also creates a
`SandboxPreviewHTTPRoute` infrastructure resource beside each `SandboxRunner`.
That companion template creates a Gateway API `HTTPRoute` that attaches to the
configured parent Gateway and routes traffic to the shared preview-gateway
Service.

Preview browser traffic does not use the App Studio provider backend path. The
browser goes to the preview host, the cluster Gateway routes to the
preview-gateway Service, and the preview gateway validates the signed session
before proxying to the sandbox Service.

In the Helm chart, set `runtimeKubeconfig.secretName` to a Secret with key
`kubeconfig` to enable those runtime data-plane APIs. Leaving it empty starts App
Studio normally with sandbox runtime operations disabled.

See `../../docs/app-studio-sandbox-runtime.md` for the current runtime boundary
and caveats.
