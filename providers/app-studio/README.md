App Studio is a kedge provider that gives each tenant a **persistent AI project
workspace**: named Projects with durable "memory" (goals / requirements /
constraints) and a chat surface backed by the tenant's own LLM credentials,
with optional MCP tool use against their workspace. Projects are stored as
`projects.ai.kedge.faros.sh` resources in the tenant's own kcp workspace; chat
transcripts persist in the provider's message store (Postgres in production and
local dev, with explicit in-memory mode available only for throwaway UI work).

The provider acts **as the calling user**: the hub's backend proxy forwards
`/services/providers/app-studio/*` with the verified `X-Kedge-Tenant` /
`X-Kedge-User` headers and the caller's bearer token, and the provider builds a
per-request, token-scoped client (see `tenant/`). There is no provider
service-account escalation.

## What's here

| Surface | Where |
|---|---|
| Provider binary | `main.go` — loads the provider kubeconfig, opens the message store, mounts `/api` + the embedded portal, heartbeats the hub |
| REST / LLM / message API | `api/` — Project CRUD, memory, LLM settings, streaming chat (`/api/projects/*`) |
| API type | `apis/ai/v1alpha1/` — the `Project` CRD type (deepcopy generated) |
| Typed client | `client/` — trimmed dynamic client for the Project resource |
| Tenant client | `tenant/` — token-forwarding `ClientFactory` (host+TLS from the provider kubeconfig, caller token per request) |
| Message store | `store/` — Postgres + in-memory + envelope-encryption implementations |
| Sandbox runtime | `runner/` + `api/development_*` — project-scoped sync, restart, logs, status, and signed preview proxy for infrastructure-backed `SandboxRunner` workloads |
| Portal | `portal/` — the Vue micro-frontend (`<kedge-provider-app-studio>`), embedded via `assets.go` |
| Registration | `manifest.yaml` — CatalogEntry + APIExport (`ai.kedge.faros.sh`) + Code and Infrastructure provider dependencies + the Project APIResourceSchema + `secrets` claim |
| Deploy | `deploy/chart/` — Helm chart (Deployment, Service, CatalogEntry) |
| CI (mirror) | `.github/workflows/{image,chart}.yaml` — publish the image + chart to GHCR (run only in the mirror) |

## Configuration

Environment variables consumed by the binary:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Listen port (default `8081`) |
| `KEDGE_HUB_URL` | Hub base URL (heartbeat + MCP endpoint resolution) |
| `KEDGE_HUB_TOKEN` | Bearer token for the heartbeat |
| `KEDGE_PROVIDER_NAME` | CatalogEntry name (default `app-studio`) |
| `KEDGE_PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG` | Provider kubeconfig (kcp front-proxy host + TLS only) |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BASE_DOMAIN` | Optional DNS zone for companion Sandbox preview routing. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_HTTPROUTE_PARENT_GATEWAY_NAME` | Gateway resource name to attach each preview `HTTPRoute` to. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_HTTPROUTE_PARENT_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` | Namespace of the parent Gateway (defaults to `kedge-preview`). |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_HTTPROUTE_PARENT_GATEWAY_SECTION_NAME` | Listener section name on the parent Gateway (defaults to `https`). |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BACKEND_NAMESPACE` | Namespace for the shared preview gateway Service backend. The Helm chart sets this to the release namespace unless `previewGateway.backend.namespace` is configured. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME` | Shared preview gateway Service name. Defaults to the chart-created `preview-gateway` Service when unset. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT` | Shared preview gateway Service port (defaults to `8080`). |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_TOKEN_SECRET` | Optional shared signing secret for preview URLs; configure for multi-replica deployments |
| `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` | Postgres DSN for the message store |
| `APP_STUDIO_IN_MEMORY_MESSAGE_STORE` | `true` → non-durable in-memory store (dev) |
| `APP_STUDIO_MESSAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` | Comma-separated `key-id:base64-aes-key` entries for message content and metadata encryption at rest |
| `APP_STUDIO_MESSAGE_RETENTION` | Retention window (`time.ParseDuration`, e.g. `720h`) |
| `APP_STUDIO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Filesystem root for App Studio project workspaces and local file tools |
| `APP_STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` | How long an assistant run stays undoable (`time.ParseDuration`, default `72h`). `0` keeps undo snapshots until the project is deleted — they share the workspace volume with every tenant, so unbounded retention eventually fails all writes. |
| `APP_STUDIO_MCP_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` | `true` → skip TLS verify on MCP calls (dev) |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` | `true` → skip TLS verification only for preview readiness probes (local dev with a self-signed Gateway) |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_CONSOLE_ENABLED` | Automatically shares bounded browser-console evidence while the embedded preview is open; set `false` for a deployment-wide kill switch. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_CONSOLE_SIGNING_KEY` | PEM-encoded P-256 private key used to sign short-lived ES256 iframe capabilities |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_CONSOLE_SIGNING_KEY_ID` | Stable key ID matching the public JWK independently deployed to the preview bridge |

## Local message history

`make run-provider-app-studio` starts/reuses a local Postgres container by
default and passes `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` to the provider:

```sh
make app-studio-db-up
make run-provider-app-studio
```

The database container is named `kedge-app-studio-postgres`, listens on
`127.0.0.1:55432`, and stores data under `.kcp/app-studio-postgres/`. Both
Tiltfiles expose it as the `app-studio-db` resource, so hard-refreshing the UI
or rebuilding the provider no longer drops prior conversation history.

Both Tilt stacks also expose an `app-studio-preview-console-key` resource.
It atomically generates and reuses a P-256 key under
`.kcp/app-studio-preview-console/`. The App Studio process receives the private
key and derived key ID; Infrastructure receives only the matching public JWKS
and propagates it into development-preview init containers. The directory is
gitignored and uses mode `0700`; the private key uses mode `0600`. Delete that
directory only when intentionally rotating the local key, then restart the
App Studio and Infrastructure Tilt resources so both sides receive the new
pair. Local Make/Tilt targets intentionally ignore one-sided signing-key or
JWKS environment overrides; use the Helm values or launch the binaries directly
when testing a custom key pair.

To use your own database, set `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` in the environment or in
`providers/app-studio/.env` (copy from `.env.example`). To intentionally use the
old throwaway behavior, set `APP_STUDIO_IN_MEMORY_MESSAGE_STORE=true`.

## Resilient assistant conversations

Once a Project and its first user message exist, App Studio owns assistant work
on the provider lifecycle rather than on an HTTP request. `POST
/api/projects/{project}/messages` creates durable user, assistant, and run
records, and clients recover with `GET .../assistant/runs/latest` then subscribe
to `GET .../assistant/{run}/stream`. Closing a stream only removes that
subscriber; it never cancels the worker. The portal uses this contract for the
first project turn as well as later messages, so a refresh during generation
reconnects without adding another prompt.

Every request carries an assistant action. Omitted actions are `auto`: the run
starts in an adaptive mode with bounded project reads but no WorkItem or
mutation authority. It may answer directly, inspect the project, or request
plan approval. A plan request atomically promotes that same run and its root
messages into a durable, actor-bound WorkItem before the permission checkpoint
is saved. Explicit Ask remains read-only; explicit Build creates the WorkItem
at start; `continue` requires a selected suspended WorkItem ID and exact
revision. Mutation history, plan grants, runs, and messages are scoped by the
immutable Kubernetes Project UID and WorkItem rather than by the reusable
project name. The portal exposes only Adaptive and Discuss; explicit `build`
and `continue` remain API compatibility contracts for existing clients and
persisted runs, not composer choices.

Mutation-capable Eino runs expose a phase-specific tool catalog for
`approval -> mutate -> verify -> repair/warmup/commit -> report`, while every tool
invocation still validates the durable lifecycle and grant. A phase-local
no-progress bound warns the model before stopping a run that keeps reasoning
without plan approval or an approved source mutation. The WorkItem is suspended
with reason `no_progress`; a new Adaptive message starts a fresh turn from the
preserved project state. After a source mutation, the strict verification
catalog and global iteration ceiling apply so a run-local mutation marker is
never discarded by this handoff. This does not apply to read-only Ask turns.

Patch conflicts enter a persisted two-step recovery lane: reread only the failed
target, then retry only `apply_patch` for that target. Transient runtime
provisioning and missing process evidence enter a bounded operational lane with
only status, preview, logs, and verification reads. Source repair reopens only
when verification reports concrete build or application log blockers.

Runtime failures are diagnosed before they reach the model. Dev-server output is
classified into structured issues (missing module, missing script, syntax,
compile, port-in-use, permission-denied, process-crash), each carrying the
subject of the fault, a workspace-relative location where the runtime named one,
and a concrete remediation. Verification reports that diagnosis rather than "the
logs contain a failure", and the lane is chosen by fault class: only diagnosed
*source* defects open source repair, while operational faults (a bound port, a
denied filesystem operation) route to the operational lane instead of sending
the assistant to edit code that was never at fault. Browser-side JavaScript
errors are **not** captured — nothing in the preview HTTP path is owned by
kedge, so there is no injection point for a client error shim.

A run that keeps repeating an action, or keeps reasoning without progress, is
stopped after a bounded number of unproductive model calls (warned first) and
its WorkItem is suspended with reason `no_progress`, resumable with Continue.
That bound is deliberately far below the global iteration ceiling.

Under `auto_approve`, verbs that are irreversible or externally visible still
require confirmation: `hydrate_workspace` (replaces the workspace, discarding
uncommitted work with no undo snapshot), `promote_project`, and
`infrastructure__provision`. Ordinary edits stay auto-approvable because they
are snapshotted and undoable.

This remains a single-replica design: execution cannot continue across a
provider restart. On the next read, an orphaned running run is surfaced as
`interrupted`; its WorkItem becomes suspended, while permission and input
checkpoints stay resumable. Run ownership is inferred from this process's
memory, which is only sound at one replica — the Helm chart refuses to render
above one. Raising it requires a durable owner lease (owner identity plus a
heartbeat, reconciling only expired leases); without one, a second replica
would interrupt the first replica's live runs mid-mutation. Stop first persists `stopping`, then asks Eino to
cancel gracefully without retaining a terminal checkpoint. Assistant starts
use the durable `POST /messages` boundary; the legacy POST-SSE project and
message endpoints have been removed. Clients must not depend on token replay:
the remaining GET stream provides complete revisioned snapshots, and a
reconnect receives the latest one.

A project runs one task at a time. The portal's **Activity** tab is where that
is visible: what the assistant is working on now (with Stop), and every task
with its state and only the actions the backend will accept — Continue or
Discard for a paused task, Stop for a running one. A task still marked running
by a run that is gone is released by reconciliation, which the work-item list
and cancel endpoints now perform before reading, so it cannot wedge new work.

Lifecycle logs contain only organization, workspace, project, run, revision,
and status fields. They intentionally omit prompt text, assistant content,
tool arguments, and credentials.

Useful checks from this module:

```sh
go test ./...
go test -race ./api ./store ./workspace
cd portal \
  && npm run test:workbench \
  && npm run test:preview-state \
  && npm run test:create-readiness \
  && npm run test:llm-settings \
  && npm run test:assistant-actions \
  && npm run test:assistant-plan \
  && npm run test:assistant-plan-popover \
  && npm run test:conversation-resilience \
  && npm run test:activity \
  && npm run test:approval-mode \
  && npm run test:response-mode \
  && npm run typecheck \
  && npm run build
```

## Local project files

App Studio keeps project files in its own workspace root so the assistant can
list, read, search, and safely mutate text files before asking provider-code to
commit selected changed files to git. Set `APP_STUDIO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to choose
the directory; the binary defaults to a temp directory, while the Helm chart
mounts a persistent volume at `/var/lib/kedge-app-studio/workspaces`.

The assistant-facing workspace tools are App Studio local tools. Provider-code
remains the git-source boundary: `commit_project_files` reads selected workspace
files and delegates the actual commit to the Code provider's `code__commit_files`
tool.

Every workspace mutation (`write_file`, `apply_patch`, `delete_file`) is
recorded in a per-run snapshot, which is what `POST
/api/projects/{project}/assistant/{run}/undo` restores and what the portal's
"Undo file changes" control calls. Snapshots are swept on age — see
`APP_STUDIO_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION`.

`delete_file` removes a file from the workspace and records a tombstone so the
next sync removes it from the development sandbox too; without that, a renamed
file kept running there. **Deletion does not reach git**: removing a file from
the repository additionally requires deleting it there, because the Code
provider's commit bundle carries only path+content. Mutations lock per project
workspace, not store-wide, so one tenant's slow write does not block another's.

## Development runtime

App Studio owns the project-facing development runtime API. It creates and
deletes infrastructure-backed `SandboxRunner` resources in the caller's tenant
workspace, syncs App Studio workspace files to the runner, and serves project
preview URLs by minting signed, host-based URLs from the companion
`SandboxPreviewHTTPRoute` status.

Sync is incremental: App Studio records the content hashes last confirmed for
each component and ships only what changed, plus explicit `deletePaths`. This is
safe because sandbox files live on a PVC, so pod restarts preserve them; the
recorded state is discarded — forcing a full sync — on any failed sync, on a
template switch or hydrate that replaces the volume, and on provider restart. A
workspace above the 500-file listing limit fails the sync with an explanation
rather than shipping an alphabetical prefix of the tree, and files the payload
cannot carry (binary, oversized) are reported as `skippedFiles` rather than
silently dropped.

Infrastructure owns the resource composition: the `sandbox-runner` Template uses
KRO to create the runtime namespace, PVC, Deployment, Service, control Secret,
and network policy. App Studio holds **no** kubeconfig to the runtime cluster:
the live data plane (logs, file sync, restart, preview readiness) is served by
the infrastructure provider as subresources on the `SandboxRunner` instance,
which App Studio calls through the hub as the requesting user. See
[`docs/app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md`](../../docs/app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md).

This is the platform
[provider-isolation rule](../../docs/providers.md#provider-isolation-the-cross-provider-boundary)
in practice: App Studio reaches infrastructure-owned workloads only through
the `SandboxRunner` CR and its published subresources — never into the
infrastructure provider's runtime cluster — which is what lets a tenant be
backed by a different infrastructure provider (BYO compute) with no App
Studio change.

When `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BASE_DOMAIN` is set, App Studio also creates a
`SandboxPreviewHTTPRoute` infrastructure resource beside each `SandboxRunner`.
That companion template creates a Gateway API `HTTPRoute` that attaches to the
configured parent Gateway and routes traffic to the shared preview-gateway
Service.

Preview browser traffic does not use the App Studio provider backend path. The
browser goes to the preview host, the cluster Gateway routes to the
preview-gateway Service, and the preview gateway validates the signed session
before proxying to the sandbox Service.

In the Helm chart, set `runtimeKubeconfig.secretName` to a Secret with key
`kubeconfig` to enable those runtime data-plane APIs. Leaving it empty starts App
Studio normally with sandbox runtime operations disabled.

See `../../docs/app-studio-sandbox-runtime.md` for the current runtime boundary
and caveats.
